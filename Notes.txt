This app is powered by Next js,typeScript,Graphql,Supabase,Stepzen and Next-auth.

Next auth is so cool , we can implemet any methods using it.

Here i use postgressSql for the first time.

For that,I use Supabase as database- Supabase is postgress database.
we can write schema using tables in supabase.

To fetch data from supabase ,we use Graphql query  to get data. for that ,we have Stepzen ,Stepzen is declarative way to write graphql query ,
 we pass our supabase db to stepzen and it creates all queries . 

To use those backend data in frontend , we have something called apollo client- it allows us to consume data from backend.

By using apollo client , we have to setup and pass stepzen key to apollo client. 

we cover our entire app with appolo client .
